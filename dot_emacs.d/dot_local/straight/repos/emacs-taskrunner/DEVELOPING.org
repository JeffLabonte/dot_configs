* Working on Emacs Taskrunner
So far, no automated tests have been made but this is planned for the
future. Currently, all testing is done manually and relies on open-source
projects which use the build systems in question.

To setup the project for testing, either evaluate the following shell code block
or run the commands within in a shell.

*Running this will freeze emacs until the folders are cloned*
